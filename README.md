# Applications of Cooperative Multi-Robot Collection

## Overview
This project designs an automated multi-robot system for ball collection (tennis, badminton, table tennis)[tennis focused] using YOLOv8n, Python, and Arduino.  
Robots are equipped with ESP32-CAM for vision input and controlled via PID-based servo mechanisms.  

## Project Structure
- `src/` â€“ Python and Arduino source code  
- `cad/` â€“ Circuit diagrams and CAD files  
- `docs/` â€“ Reports and project documents [Mandarin version]  
- `dataset/` â€“ Small sample of training images (full dataset available via Roboflow)  

## Dataset
A sample dataset is provided in `/dataset/`.  
The full dataset (9,500 images) is hosted on Roboflow:
